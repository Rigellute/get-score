## No need to wait

This is a small Firefox extension to skip the 15 second waiting time when opening a score on http://imslp.org/.

If the script detects a score, the user is prompted to open immediately.

For example, go [here](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/368189/torat) to download the Nocturne in C-sharp minor, B.49 by Chopin

## Usage

To install locally, clone the repo and open "about:debugging" in Firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select any file in your extension's directory.
